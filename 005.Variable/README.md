# Variable
What is Variable, Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables)

## Short Hand Declaration
Go also provides another concise way to declare variables. This is known as short hand declaration and it uses := operator.
name := initialvalue is the short hand syntax to declare a variable.[Golangbot.com](https://golangbot.com/variables/)

## Declaration Multiple Variable
Multiple variables can be declared using a single statement. var name1, name2 type = initialvalue1, initialvalue2 is the syntax for multiple variable declaration. The type can be removed if the variables have an initial value. Since the above program has initial values for variables, the int type can be removed.
